# Explainee - News Explainer AI

Explainee is an intelligent news explainer web app designed to simplify complex news articles, especially for multilingual audiences. Users can paste any news article URL, and the app automatically fetches the content, detects its language, and translates it to English if necessary. It then summarizes the article, extracts important people, organizations, and locations, and provides a glossary with instant Wikipedia-based explanations. Built using Python, Streamlit, and NLP tools like spaCy and Wikipedia API, the project is modular, efficient, and scalable. Explainee is especially useful for readers who face information overload or language barriers, offering a clean, interactive interface to explore and understand the core of any news story.
